# Eclipse Ditto Client

Eclipse Ditto Project - https://eclipse.dev/ditto/index.html

This repository is the python client generated using Microsoft Kiota ([https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-python](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-python))

## Install

```bash
uv add ditto-client
```

## Running Ditto

A sample docker compose is provided as part of this repository.

You must run the ditto services outside the devcontainer as they consume lot of resources.

```bash
# outside your devcontainer (i.e. on your host)
# at <your_path>/ditto-client dir
docker compose -f assets/ditto/docker-compose.yaml up
```

## Usage

```python
auth_provider = BasicAuthProvider(user_name=_USERNAME, password=_PASSWORD)

request_adapter = HttpxRequestAdapter(auth_provider)
request_adapter.base_url = "http://host.docker.internal:8080"

ditto_client = DittoClient(request_adapter)

response = await ditto_client.api.two.things.get()
```

Default setup for Ditto uses Ngix with basic authentication. A custom authentication provider has been included
in the library to support it. See [BasicAuth Provider](src/ditto_client/basic_auth.py).

[See examples/basic.py for the full usage](examples/basic.py)

## Usage - CLI

The Ditto client includes a comprehensive CLI for interacting with Eclipse Ditto services. The CLI provides the following commands:

| Command Group | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `policy` | Manage access policies |
| `thing` | Manage things (digital twins) |
| `search` | Search for things |
| `connection` | Manage connections |
| `devops` | DevOps operations |
| `permission` | Check permissions |
| `config` | View service configuration |
| `logging` | Manage logging configuration |


### Global Configuration

The CLI uses the following environment variables, you can set it as per your environment:

```bash
export DITTO_BASE_URL="http://host.docker.internal:8080"
export DITTO_USERNAME="ditto"
export DITTO_PASSWORD="ditto"
export DITTO_DEVOPS_USERNAME="devops"
export DITTO_DEVOPS_PASSWORD="foobar"
```

ditto-client thing list

# List things with specific fields
ditto-client thing list --fields "thingId,attributes"

# List specific things by ID
ditto-client thing list --ids "my.namespace:new-thing"
```

#### Retrieve a specific thing by ID.

# Search with filter
ditto-client search query --filter 'eq(attributes/location,"Kitchen")'

# Search with size limit and sorting
ditto-client search query --option "size(3),sort(+thingId)"

# Search in specific namespaces
ditto-client search query --namespaces "my.namespace"
```

#### Count things matching search criteria.

```bash
# Count all things
ditto-client search count

# Count things with filter
ditto-client search count --filter 'eq(attributes/location,"Kitchen")'
```
